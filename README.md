# The triple bookkeeping - the accounting of the future
Accounts are typically historical, i.e. they describe things that happened in the past.
The vision of future accounting is that past, present and future merge.
So if you dream of a live account that is not just up to date for the here and now, but with a built-in crystal ball, n4s could be the framework around this.

If we are to make a technological quantum leap, we have to work together.
Instead of many providers of accounting systems having to be sell SAAS solutions in their own camps and solving the same problems aka reinventing the wheel over and over, we can help each other build a strong system that is commonly owned for now and forever.
That's why n4s is launched as **free software** - free software is often confused with being free, but that's not always the case. Free therefore does not refer to price, but to freedom, as in that the software respects some basic rights that we believe should accompany all software:
* The freedom to use the program for any purpose (freedom 0).
* The freedom to learn how the program works and change it according to your own needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a condition for this.
* The freedom to redistribute copies (freedom 2).
* The freedom to improve the software and release the improvements to the public for the benefit of society as a whole (freedom 3). Access to the source code is also a condition for this.

There is a time cost with starting up a new system, and if you need to use the system professionally and have it set up to comply with current legislation, you should seek expert guidance. However, this does not apply to small businesses with a turnover of less than 300,000

If you are missing a feature, you can offer a bounty for such a feature. If several people offer a bounty for the same feature, the bounty can increase and make it more attractive for a developer to make it.

# A simple and free accounting program
N4S is a free and open source accounting system, and thus free to use now and forever.

It is almost safe to say that n4s is one of the cheapest accounting programs on the market.
It only costs the time you have to invest in working in a more efficient way.
You can get started by downloading and trying our OVA version on your machine, absolutely free.

When you do bookeeping in N4S, your accounting becomes a breeze. Once you learn it... !

Whether you have a brand new company, an association or just your household accounts, here you have an accounting program that can support your activities from now on and always.

Our vision is that it should be simple and efficient to do your bookkeeping, VAT accounting, household accounting and more.

Your data can be easily exported to an open format that you can take with you later to any other system.

## Key selling points
### Lord in his own house
With n4s you have full control over your own data.

### Velocity
n4s is faster than other systems on the market. Most operations take place in a split second. Only your processing power and hard disk/ram set the limit to how quickly the system is run, and for most small accounts you won't blink until you get the data you ask for on the screen.

### Possibility of automatic consolidation and allocation between subsidiaries
n4s can easily be set up to automatically consolidate your accounts below:
* Automatic transfer of result
* Automatic reconciliation of interim accounts

### Automatic accounting based on own defined rules *
in n4s you can define rules yourself for how your new postings are to be accounted for.
This means you can get rid of manual posting again and again of the same type of items
eg. IF Text = 'Fee' THEN Account = 'Expenses:Administration:Fees'

### Secured against acquisition
n4s stands for Not 4 Sale - translated 'not for sale'. Therefore, it is secured against acquisition, so that the system will always be free.
You are welcome to clone our system and sell it on, but on the condition that you respect the basic rights of the users...
... Conditions which are described in more detail in the software's license which is GPL v3


### Save time - automatic posting suggestions
When loading new entries, you can save time because the system itself can make suggestions based on your previous history.
Even with very little data, you quickly get suggestions for accounting - based on similar_text, which is often referred to as one of the world's best algorithms.
Many entries with the same text end up in the same place every time - the system even detects when there are deviations and requires great precision to make suggestions
That is, you do not need to go in and define rules for simple fee postings, because the system automatically detects that they always end up on the same account... !

### Running updates
You don't have to wait years for a new version to be released. You can continuously download patches with improvements to the system.
Follow this link to see the latest changes to the system.
It takes under a minute to update the n4s to the latest version.
You can also make changes to the code yourself and suggest that these changes become part of n4s.
You can see how easily the system is updated in our Quick Start Videos


# N4S - a free and free accounting and ERP solution for small businesses and individuals
However, N4S is more than just an accounting system; it is a powerful ally on your journey to business success. Whether you're an accounting professional, an entrepreneur or a business owner, N4S has the tools you need to gain superior control over your finances and business processes.

**Ownership:**
Another advantage of the early software was ownership üìú. Once you paid for a program üí∞, it was yours. There were no subscription models, no ongoing costs and no need for a constant internet connection üåê. You could use the software whenever you wanted without worrying about extensive restrictions or licensing restrictions. However, it should be mentioned that these days most commercial programs were under a strict license that denied the user each of the previously mentioned basic software rights. This can be seen as a necessity to promote the development of software, as it was difficult to find models for revenue beyond copyright and its enforcement - and that secrecy of the source code was a necessity as a defense against pirates.

**Source Code Access and Customization:**
Although modern accounting systems have their own advantages, there is still something unique about n4s ü§ñ. A notable advantage of n4s is the access to the source code üß©. This allows companies to adapt n4s precisely to their needs üß∞. With access to the source code, companies can make changes, add features and optimize the system according to their unique requirements üõ†Ô∏èn. This degree of customization gives unprecedented control over the company's accounting system and ensures that it meets their specific needs. Even if you are not a programmer and do not want to invest in using one, you can easily make simple changes by searching the source code, e.g. changing the text of buttons, colors and the like.

**Online Functionality and Collaboration:**
So while we may miss the days when everything seemed simpler with DOS programs, it is important to recognize that modern technology has brought us many benefits üåê.
It's important to note that although the n4s is based on a terminal, don't be fooled by this. N4S is still incredibly functional and designed to be a multi-user system that can work online from anywhere üåê. The terminal-based approach provides a unique opportunity for collaboration, as multiple users can easily access the system and work together on tasks. This makes it a powerful tool for modern businesses seeking efficiency and collaboration ü§ù. Screen sharing is part of the system from the start and does not require separate software.

üöÄ *Lightning fast and Universal*: With N4S you can work efficiently on any platform! The technology behind it is known for its incredible speed, which means you can focus on what really matters: driving your business forward.

ü§ì *Made for Professionals*: N4s was first developed with accounting professionals in mind and allows you to take control of your finances like never before. You will feel like a real expert when you use this powerful tool.

ü§ñ *Automated Accounting*: With N4S you can define rules that automate the accounting process. This saves you time and reduces the risk of errors. Let N4S take care of the routine tasks so you can focus on strategic planning. This combined with the fact that the system automatically teaches itself rules based on your previous postings and the bookkeeping thereby becomes less and less time-consuming, without you having to do anything actively, other than using the system.

üíº *Your Data, Your Control*: One of the most compelling features of N4S is that you have full control over your data. You host it on your own server, which means your information is always in your hands. And the best of all? You can do it for as little as $5 a month on Linode!

# Do you miss the good old DOS days without so much BS or expensive subscriptions?
Today, when technology and computers are constantly evolving üöÄ, it can be tempting to look back to the good old days of the 1990s üï∞Ô∏è when the DOS operating system and early accounting systems were dominant üíæ. There is something nostalgic about the time when computers and software worked in a simpler way and the user experience had its own charming qualities.

**Stability and Reliability:**
In the DOS days there were rarely worries about server downtime ‚è≥. The old accounting systems were usually run locally on a single computer üíª, which meant you had full control over your system üõ†Ô∏è. There was no dependency on complex server infrastructures that could fail, and it provided a sense of stability and reliability üè¢.

**Responsiveness:**
One of the remarkable things about the DOS era was the instant response you got from your computer ‚ö°. When you pressed a button üéÆ or wanted to generate a report üìä in the old accounting systems, there was no waiting time ‚åõ. The software responded almost instantly, making the work process fast and efficient üí®.



# VT100 - The only terminal based program on the market
## Modern System built on legendary VT100 Technology üíª
Our system draws on the venerable VT100 technology, which saw the light of day back in 1978. This is not just a technology; it's a legacy, a source of speed and portability, and it's the key to an efficient and smooth working experience.

## üöÄ **Blazing Fast Performance**
The VT100 technology that forms the basis of our system is known for its extreme speed. Its simple and efficient design enables our system to perform tasks at lightning speed. This means you can work more efficiently and focus on what really matters.

Imagine you are sitting on the train and you lose the connection between two masts - this can e.g. be there is a blackout while passing √òresund. You can continue typing in the terminal without worrying about this, as your keystrokes will be reflected on the other side of the strait when the connection is re-established. It could also be that you are on a 5G connection in the city, and 50,000 protesters and their mobile phones strain the network to such an extent that there are outages. This is no obstacle for a terminal-based system.

Regarding the speed, we can state that there is no spinning symbol while it waits for a response from the server, likewise you do not have to go out and get coffee while you wait for the cash register to be posted. Our vision is that everything you do in the system is reflected immediately.
There is also no limit on how many entries you can display at a time.

If you e.g. have a small account with a little 20,000 entries, it takes approximately 300-400ms (0.3-0.4 seconds) to produce a full balance balance or account card on the screen. A classic problem with balances and credit cards is that you wear out your eyes and the mouse's scroll wheel. In n4s you don't need to show a full balance. You can just show the section of the balance you need, e.g. cash or all assets.
Likewise with credit cards - you can quickly generate credit cards for any given account or main category.
The following command will show you the breakdown of all your expenses in order of magnitude:

> l r expenses -S amount


The following command will show you the specification of your administration costs in text order
> l r admin -S payee


You don't even need to type the same command more than once. The system remembers your previously used commands so they can be easily reused.

## üåê **Portability at its Core**

With the VT100 technology as a foundation, our system has built-in portability. No matter where you are, you can easily access the system and perform your tasks without any hassle. This makes it the ideal choice for modern professionals who are constantly on the go.
If you can do without fancy unicode symbols and √¶, √∏ and √•, you can actually run the system via a serial connection to an old terminal from the 80s.
You can connect via PC, Mac, Linux, Android, iPhone - You name it.

## üßëüíª **Learning curve like a Ninjitsu master**
Many former key operators, aka data nauts, who have now retired, have embraced and embraced this technology with no problems. VT100 technology has proven to be exceptionally easy to learn, even for those with no prior knowledge. Those who have taken the plunge have experienced a transformation and become as fast as ninjas within a short time.
The advantage of our text-based system is, among other things, that when you know the system you can enter data without looking - you know where you are in the program based on your keystrokes and various outputs from the system.

## üåü **Choose the Future with VT100-Anchored Technology**
Dive into the past and embrace the future with our system that honors the legendary VT100 technology. Experience the speed, portability and simplicity of a terminal-based system and see how it can transform your workday.

Read on if that sounds interesting!
