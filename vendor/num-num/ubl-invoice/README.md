## Installation and usage

This package requires PHP 7.4 or higher and is fully compatible with PHP8. Installation can be done through [composer](https://www.getcomposer.org).

```zsh
$ composer require num-num/ubl-invoice
```

## Contributing

This library is not 100% UBL/Peppol feature-complete, in the sense that it doesn't (yet) support **all** UBL XML tags & functionality. "Yet" being the keyword, since this definitely is the long-term goal. All common UBL tags that are required for most invoices are present in the library. This includes tags for discounts, cash discounts, special vat rates, etc...

If you are missing functionality, please feel free to add it :-) Adding additional tags & attributes is fairly straight-forward. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
